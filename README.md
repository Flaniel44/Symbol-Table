# Symbol-Table
Level 4 Compilers Assignment 3

A symbol table component in my PLATYPUS compiler. The symbol table component consists of two parts: a Symbol Table Manager (hereafter abbreviated STM) and a Symbol Table Database (hereafter abbreviated STDB). The STM provides utilities (service functions) for manipulation of the STBD. The STDB is a repository for VID attributes. Each variable identifier is associated with one record in the database. Five VID attributes will be defined in the symbol table: variable name, type, initial value, line number, and one reserved attribute. The scanner can identify and store in the symbol table only four of those attributes: the lexeme for the VID, the line number of the line where the corresponding VID appears for the first time in the source program, the default type, and initial value of the variable. The last two might be changed later by the parser and the semantic analyzer. The fifth attribute (reserved) is reservedfor future use and mustnot be used in this implementation.
